        one player turns out to be a spy who doesn't know anything about the location. 
        His task is determining the location due to questions and answers between participants and not to reveal himself. 
        Each peaceful player for his part tries to make it clear to "friends" that he isn't a spy.
        Observation, concentration, endurance, cunning â€” everything will come in handy in this game. Watch your back!`,
